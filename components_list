## üìù Notes

- The **CPU fan** is mounted inside a bottle or chamber to create suction.
- The **ultrasonic sensor** helps the robot avoid obstacles by calculating the safest direction to move.
- You can extend this system with **IR sensors** to follow predefined paths or room boundaries.
- A **separate 9V battery** is recommended for the suction motor to avoid voltage drop on logic side.
